numbers greater than zero have no noticeable affect on the notification process
if the host is currently in an UP state.

SET_SVC_NOTIFICATION_NUMBER;<host_name>;<service_description>;<notification_number>

of another scheduled downtime entry. Set the "trigger_id" argument to zero (0)
if the downtime for the specified (parent) host should not be triggered by
another downtime entry.

   Schedules the next active check of a specified service at "check_time". The
"check_time" argument is specified in time_t format (seconds since the UNIX
epoch). Note that the service may not actually be checked at the time you
specify. This could occur for a number of reasons: active checks are disabled
on a program-wide or service-specific basis, the service is already scheduled
to be checked at an earlier time, etc. If you want to force the service check
to occur at the time you specify, look at the SCHEDULE_FORCED_SVC_CHECK

are disabled on a program-wide or service-specific basis, the services are
already scheduled to be checked at an earlier time, etc. If you want to force
the service checks to occur at the time you specify, look at the
SCHEDULE_FORCED_HOST_SVC_CHECKS command.

SAVE_STATE_INFORMATION

   Causes Nagios to save all current monitoring status information to the state
retention file. Normally, state retention information is saved before the
Nagios process shuts down and (potentially) at regularly scheduled intervals.
This command allows you to force Nagios to save this information to the state
retention file immediately. This does not affect the current status information
in the Nagios process.

READ_STATE_INFORMATION

   Causes Nagios to load all current monitoring status information from the
state retention file. Normally, state retention information is loaded when the
Nagios process starts up and before it starts monitoring. WARNING: This command
will cause Nagios to discard all current monitoring status information and use
the information stored in state retention file! Use with care.

format (seconds since the UNIX epoch). Note that this will only have an affect
if the service stays in the same problem state that it is currently in. If the
service changes to another state, a new notification may go out before the time
you specify in the "notification_time" argument.

   Delays the next notification for a parciular service until
"notification_time". The "notification_time" argument is specified in time_t

service changes to another state, a new notification may go out before the time
you specify in the "notification_time" argument.

ACKNOWLEDGE_HOST_PROBLEM;<host_name>;<sticky>;<notify>;<persistent>;<author>;<comment>

   Allows you to acknowledge the current problem for the specified host. By
acknowledging the current problem, future notifications (for the same host
state) are disabled. If the "sticky" option is set to one (1), the
acknowledgement will remain until the host returns to an UP state. Otherwise
the acknowledgement will automatically be removed when the host changes state.
If the "notify" option is set to one (1), a notification will be sent out to
contacts indicating that the current host problem has been acknowledged. If the
"persistent" option is set to one (1), the comment associated with the
acknowledgement will survive across restarts of the Nagios process. If not, the
comment will be deleted the next time Nagios restarts.

servicestate) are disabled. If the "sticky" option is set to one (1), the
acknowledgement will remain until the service returns to an OK state. Otherwise
the acknowledgement will automatically be removed when the service changes
state. If the "notify" option is set to one (1), a notification will be sent
out to contacts indicating that the current service problem has been
acknowledged. If the "persistent" option is set to one (1), the comment
associated with the acknowledgement will survive across restarts of the Nagios
process. If not, the comment will be deleted the next time Nagios restarts.
